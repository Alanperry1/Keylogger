## Project Overview

This keylogger is a software tool designed to record and log keystrokes on a computer. It captures every key pressed by the user and stores the data in a log file for review. The keylogger is intended for educational purposes, particularly to demonstrate the capabilities of security monitoring and the importance of robust cybersecurity measures.

## Features

- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures all keystrokes made by the user, including special keys.
- **Stealth Mode**: Runs in the background without noticeable impact on system performance.
- **Log File Management**: Stores captured keystrokes in a plain text file.
- **Customizable Settings**: Options to modify the logging interval and log file path.
- **Email Reporting (Optional)**: Sends the log file to a specified email address periodically.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keylogger.git
   cd keylogger
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   This keylogger is written in Python. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Keylogger**:
   Execute the keylogger script:
   ```
   python keylogger.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Running in Stealth Mode**: The keylogger runs in the background without any visible window or notification.

2. **Log File**: By default, the keylogger saves the log file in the same directory as the script with the name `keylog.txt`. You can specify a different path in the script if needed.

3. **Email Reporting (Optional)**: To enable email reporting, configure the SMTP settings in the script. This requires editing the `keylogger.py` file with your email credentials and desired reporting interval.

## Configuration

You can modify the following settings in the `keylogger.py` file:

- **Logging Interval**: Adjust the frequency at which keystrokes are logged.
- **Log File Path**: Change the default log file path.
- **Email Settings**: Configure SMTP settings to enable email reporting.
